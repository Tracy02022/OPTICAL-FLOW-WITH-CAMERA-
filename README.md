# OPTICAL-FLOW-WITH-CAMERA-
The goal of this project is work with the OpenCV, OpenGL open source libraries, 
and visual studio C++ to demonstrate the result of optical flow with camera capture through a computer webcam, 
as well as to show the output of the concept of featuring. 

When the program is running on PC with a webcam installed, there would be two 
windows opening. The first window has a green robot (which is drew by calling OpenGL 
functions to come up with 5 cylinders and 12 spheres with correct alignment) stays at the 
origin, with both its arms and legs moving back and forth. The second window is a 
webcam window that shows the current objects which the camera captures. Assume a 
user is sitting in front of the camera while the program is running, and the face of that 
user is dynamically captured by the camera so that the second window is showing the 
userâ€™s face and perhaps other surrounding objects
